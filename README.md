## 🚀 About Me

I’m a detail-oriented and driven Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong foundation in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and secure development. I hold a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification and am preparing for the AI Cybersecurity Associate exam to expand into AI-powered threat detection and security frameworks.

I've worked on hands-on projects like:
- 🕵️ OWASP-ZAP: Performed end-to-end vulnerability scans identifying XSS, SQL Injection, insecure cookies, and more.
- 🎣 Lockphish: Simulated real-world phishing scenarios to raise awareness about social engineering tactics.

Beyond academics, I’ve actively contributed to social service initiatives like:
- 🍚 Rice Bowl Challenge (Food distribution drive)
- 🛣️ Tech Speak: Braking for Change (Road safety innovation campaign)
- 🧑‍🏫 Student Advisor at KL CEA for mentoring and organizing community-focused tech and outreach events.
